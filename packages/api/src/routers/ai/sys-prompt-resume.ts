validated using the response schema. Your response should be a JSON object.

bullet points. You can reorder skills. You are allowed to add a maximum of 3 skills that
do not already exist. You can reword or completely rephrase the summary to appeal
to the job description. You may reorder the projects to make them more relevant based
on the job description. When adding skills or reordering skills, you should consider
that new skills should be relevant to the job description and should not be

things such as 'Domain Driven Design' are too vague and generic. Skills should reference
specific technologies or methodolgies, and not general practices.
